Made for personal use, to make my routine easier.

### Features:
- First button automatically fills up the prompt section of all images (with the same prompt) on the 4th step of model uploading on CivitAI, good if you gen all your images with a single prompt and you know they will be rated R or higher
- Second option is for the page two of the model uploading step, here the extension automatically selects Illustrious as model type and adds the first 3 resources to the model, this feature is probably not for you, but I only upload Illu LORAs and only like 3 models to go with them so it's perfect for me
